Created by Curtis Kokuloku (kokul003) and Minh Tong (tong0154)

Group member's names and x500s
    --> Curtis Kokuloku - kokul003
    --> Minh Tong - tong0154

Contributions of each partner (if working with a partner)
    --> Curtis: Implemented the ArrayList Class
        --> Merging Algorithm
        --> Pair Swapping Algorithm
        --> efficient algorithms used in both equalTo() and indexOf() methods
        --> helper methods checkSize(), isSortedChecker(), isSortedChecker(), sortHelper(), and mergeSort()
    --> Minh: Implemented the LinkedList class using some of Curtis's helper methods
        --> Completed the analysis with Curtis as a second opinion

How to compile and run your program
    --> DO NOT CLICK THE PLAY BUTTON WHEN USING YOUR FAVORITE EDITOR
    --> Download 'project3.zip' file and decompress it
    --> Use the TERMINAL
    --> Go to directory with all the files: 'project3'
    --> WARNING: Make sure you are in the right directory/module that contain all the classes
    --> Use the Test Classes provided
        --> To test the LinkedList Class:
            Type javac LinkedListTest.java to compile and then java LinkedListTest to run
        --> To test teh ArrayList Class:
            Type javac ArrayListTest.java to compile and then java ArrayListTest to run

Any assumptions
    --> Assume that all the algorithms in in every class are implemented using examples from lectures,
        own knowledge and/or other resources

Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
    --> checkSize() in ArrayList.java which checks the growth of teh arrayList as we add
    --> isSortedChecker() in ArrayList.java which checks is the array is currently sorted
    --> isSortedChecker() in LinkedList.java which also checks if the LinkedList is sorted
    --> sortHelper() in LinkedList.java which is used in sort() method to sort the LinkedList
    --> mergesort() in LinkedList.java which is used in sortHelper() method to as a helper


Any known bugs or defects in the program
    --> you can assume that there is no bugs or failures in the program
